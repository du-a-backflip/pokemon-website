         Hey, my name is Dua,
         <br>         
            And I'm currently trying to learn Mandarin!

<!--STORY TIME-->
      <p>
        When I was five years old, my parents signed me up for Mandarin classes, in the hopes that I would become a fluent speaker. They considered mandarin to be "the language of the future".
      </p>
      <p>
      <b> The only problem - the teachers mainly spoke in Mandarin(Some of them straight up didn't know English!!).</b> Looking back, 
I think that it was more of a reading and writing school - a school meant to teach already fluent Mandarin-speaking children (which I was not) how to 
read and write the actual Chinese characters themselves. I went there, almost every Sunday, for 7 years. You must be thinking 'Oh, 
you must have learned a lot then!' 
      <p>
       <b> 
           HA HA, NOPE! 
       </b>
           Honestly, I think the only good thing I got out of going to those lessons were the 
       cookies from the bakery nearby. I remember that I hated going there, and would pretend not to wake up just so I didn't have to go.

         Fastforward 5 years later, I went to highschool, and learned that they had Mandarin classes. I was kind of intrigued, and figured that, since everybody there wouldn't be Chinese, the teachers would at least teach people how to understand the language.
So I joined the class.
      </p>
         As of now, I have attended highschool mandarin for 2 years, and I'm proud to say that I've learned a lot. I can actually write essays in Chinese now! So I've decided to compile some of the stuff I've learned on this website!
