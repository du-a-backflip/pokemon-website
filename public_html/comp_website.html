I think that it was more of a reading and writing school - a school meant to teach already fluent Mandarin-speaking children how to 
read and write the actual Chinese characters themselves. I went there, almost every Sunday, for 7 years. You must be thinking 'Oh,

cookies from the bakery nearby. I remember hating them, and having a strong hatred the Chinese language itself.
